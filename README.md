# NoteNudge
## What Is it?
An Electron JS application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, NoteNudge is a simple none-intrusive app that gently nudges you to log what you've been doing throughout the word day, keeping you organized and always ready to showcase your accomplishments.

## Why Make It?

I like to log what I do throughout the workday to keep track of what I’ve accomplished, where my time was spent, and especially for when I need to provide updates on what I’ve done for the previous week (I can just refer to my notes rather than trying to remember what I’ve done). 
The **problem** is, when I’m really wrapped up in a project, I either forget or choose not to record what I’ve been doing. I end up putting down a quick, non descriptive entry at the end of the day
